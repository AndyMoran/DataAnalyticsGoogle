# Cyclistic Case Study — Rider Behavior, Revenue Impact, and Bayesian Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. It examines how Cyclistic members and casual riders behave, and whether converting casual riders to membership would support revenue growth. The analysis uses 5.4 million trips from December 2024 to November 2025 and combines descriptive statistics, revenue modelling, infrastructure patterns, predictive modelling, and Bayesian estimation.

## What This Project Covers

- Differences in member and casual rider behavior

- Trip duration, timing, and seasonal patterns

- Revenue impact of converting casual riders to members

- Station ecosystems across commuter and leisure zones

- Predictive modelling of rider type

- Bayesian modelling to quantify uncertainty in key comparisons

## Key Findings

1. Members and casual riders behave differently
   
Members take short, predictable weekday trips that match commuting patterns. Their usage is stable across the year.
Casual riders take longer, more variable trips, with strong peaks on weekends and in summer, especially near lakefront and leisure destinations.

3. Behavioural differences do not translate into revenue gains

A simple view suggests that “commuter‑like” casual riders might convert well.
The revenue analysis shows the opposite. Many casual riders spend slightly more than the annual membership fee, but not by much. When these riders convert, Cyclistic loses more casual revenue than it gains in membership fees.
The current membership price is already optimised and set low. Under this pricing, conversion reduces revenue rather than increases it.

5. Bayesian modelling strengthens the conclusions

Bayesian estimates confirm that the behavioural divide is real and stable.
Posterior distributions for trip duration, timing, and seasonal patterns show clear separation between members and casual riders.
The overlap between groups is small, and uncertainty is low.
This supports the conclusion that casual riders who resemble members are rare, and converting them does not improve revenue.

7. Infrastructure patterns reinforce the divide

Station analysis reveals two ecosystems:

- Downtown commuter corridors with short, frequent weekday trips

- Lakefront and leisure zones with long, seasonal, weekend‑heavy trips

These patterns align with the behavioural and Bayesian findings.

5. Predictive modelling confirms the strongest signals
Trip duration, season, and time of day are the clearest indicators of rider type.
These features consistently separate members from casual riders.

## Strategic Implications

Cyclistic should:

- Review membership pricing

- Strengthen operations in both commuter and leisure zones

- Base marketing and operational decisions on behavioural evidence, not assumptions

- Protect casual revenue by avoiding broad conversion campaigns

A clearer understanding of rider behavior and the financial impact of conversion helps Cyclistic improve system performance, protect revenue, and plan for long‑term growth.
